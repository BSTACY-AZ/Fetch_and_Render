# Fetch_and_Render
# Note that this repository is a work in progress!!

This repository was created as a result of an assignment within Module 15 of the MIT xPro Certificate in Coding, Full Stack Developement with MERN course. 

The assignment requirements were laid out as follows: 

Data source: Fetch data from an external source and build a site and user experience around those data. Review this list of public APIs
Links to an external site. for inspiration.

Data rendering and manipulation: Organize and display the data you fetch in a way that is appropriate to the story you are trying to tell with the data (e.g., you would likely display weather data differently than a list of books). In this case, it is important to ensure that your React components are clean and organized. This is an opportunity to practice with useEffect and useReducer.

Styles: Explore Bootstrap themes to style your site and display your data. Reflect on common conventions youâ€™ve experienced on websites as a user and try to replicate what seemed intuitive to you.

# Remaining To-Do items
* Review/Finalize how I would like to use the OnSubmit function. Need to determine best/proper way of handling a search by keyword which searches the OBJECTS rather than departments (which are shown on page load), available via the MET API
* Limit # of objects returned to a reasonable amount (some departments have 45,000 items)
* Return the objects title, culture, and primaryImageSmall values from the object array and display them using Boostrap cards
